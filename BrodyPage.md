## About Me

I love the outdoors! My favorite hobbies include running, playing tennis, hanging out with friends, hiking, football, and watching movies. My favorite movies are _Gladiator_, _3:10 to Yuma_, and _Inception_.

I am passionate about Computer Science. I am most interested in quantum computing and the theory behind it. I plan on minoring in Quantum Engineering and taking as many Math and Physics classes as I can.
